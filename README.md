## Features
  * ~Provide link to save/send result~ Done! (URL rewrites),
    * Have explicit button to copy link to clipboard...
  * ~Add new components and states~ Mostly done!
  * Simulate behavior of battery (chemical) and capacitor (linear) discharge voltage over time. Calculate brown out voltage accordingly
  * 


It is helpful to estimate the battery life ahead of time to see what tricks you need to do in order to reach the form factor you want. If you can't (even after tricks), why bother designing, laying out, and making the boards!

Min voltage w/ max current. Different modes, include supercap/LIC (which is linear discharge, unlike battery). See if you can get Google to index it. Provide link to save/send result. 

Charging time for hours of operation, etc. (how long to charge to get an hour of runtime)

Allow some knobs/graphs. Brown out voltage/current. Useful stuff

How much power is each node responsible for? What is impact of reducing sleep current by x uA? Might be more beneficial than peak power.

How much power is lost in the <linear> voltage regulators providing different power rails? Should I upgrade to switching?
